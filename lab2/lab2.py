# Lab 2
# Chit-chat ChatBots

# In the previous lab, we explored models that try to answer questions
# by reasoning over free-text inputself.

# In this lab, we will explore two types of models to create chatbots.

# First, let's consider important qualities for a chatbot system
# 1. Readability - whatever model we use, the chats it creates should be
# easily understood by humans

# 2. Consistency - when chatting with a chatbot, the bot should maintain
# consistent information. Imagine a bot that says ``Hi I'm Jack'' and then
# ``Hello, my name is Jane'' - quite confusing

# 3. Engaging - To encourage users to talk to the bot, the bot should be
# able to generate interesting, engaging responses. If the only response was
# ``wow, that's cool,'' users are quite unlikely to want to talk very much
# to the chat bot
